					<h3>Introduction to Cyber Security</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
          <section >
            <h3>What is Cyber Security?</h3>
            <p>Cybersecurity is the field of study and practice that responds to challenges as technology evolves. It is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>Why Cyber Security?</h3>
            <p>
              Cyber security is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and medical organizations collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and other devices. A significant portion of that data can be sensitive information, whether that be intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data for which unauthorized access or exposure could have negative consequences.

					<h3>CIA Triad</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
          <section>
            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>Confidentiality is the assurance that the information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, processes, or devices. It is the most important aspect of the CIA triad.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            This pillar of the triad refers to protecting private information from eyes that shouldn’t have access to it. Confidentiality is the need to enforce access - who can see this, and who shouldn’t? For example, we don’t want to give our social security number to just anyone, but we trust that the institutions we give them to - like tax services - implement the right security measures to keep it secret. So what tools are used to guarantee the right access?
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            #### Some of the ways confidentiality is managed are:
            - Keeping levels of access and setting permissions
            - Encrypting data and files
            - Using firewalls and intrusion detection systems
            - Requiring multi-factor authentication
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <section>
            <h3>Integrity</h3>
            <p>Integrity is the assurance that the information is trustworthy and accurate. It is the second most important aspect of the CIA triad.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            This pillar of the triad refers to the trustworthiness of the information. Integrity is the need to ensure that the information is accurate and reliable. For example, we trust that the information we get from our bank is accurate and reliable. So what tools are used to guarantee the right information?
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            #### Some of the ways integrity is managed are:
            - Using digital signatures
            - Using checksums
            - Using access controls
            - Using change management
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <section>
            <h3>Availability</h3>
            <p>Availability is the assurance that the information is accessible to authorized users. It is the third most important aspect of the CIA triad.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            This pillar of the triad refers to the accessibility of the information. Availability is the need to ensure that the information is accessible when needed. For example, we trust that the information we get from our bank is accessible when we need it. So what tools are used to guarantee the right access?
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            #### Some of the ways availability is managed are:
            - Using backups
            - Using redundant systems
            - Using disaster recovery plans
            - Using fault-tolerant systems

          <h3>Cyber Threats</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
          <section>
            <h3>What is a Cyber Threat?</h3>
            <p>A cyber threat is a malicious act that seeks to damage data, steal data, or disrupt digital life in general. Cyber threats can come from within an organization by trusted users or from remote locations by unknown parties. Cyber threats can be intentional or unintentional.</p>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Types of Cyber Threats 
              - Malware
              - Phishing
              - Sql injection
              - Cross Site Scripting
              - Denial of Service
              - Zero Day Exploitation
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Malware</h3>
            <p>Malware is a type of software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. Malware is a broad category that encompasses many different types of harmful software, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Phishing</h3>
            <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack, or the revealing of sensitive information.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
            <p>SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database. SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques. SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Cross Site Scripting</h3>
            <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security bug that can affect websites. It allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Denial of Service</h3>
            <p>A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Zero Day Exploitation</h3>
            <p>A zero-day (also known as 0-day) vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability that is unknown to those who should be interested in mitigating the vulnerability (including the vendor of the target software). Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network.</p>
